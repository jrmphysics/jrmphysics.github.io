                    <h1>MY EXPERIENCE</h1>
                </u>
                <p>My physics teaching experience of 14 years with class 11th and 12th students has been a rich and
                    rewarding journey.
                    I have had the privilege of guiding and mentoring thousands of students in their quest to understand
                    the fundamental laws of nature and
                    the workings of the universe. Teaching physics has allowed me to share my passion for the subject
                    and to inspire the next generation
                    of scientists and engineers. I have always aimed to make the learning experience fun and engaging,
                    using interactive methods such
                    as real-life examples, hands-on experiments, and visual aids to help the students grasp complex
                    concepts. I have also encouraged my students to
                    think critically and ask questions, fostering a positive and stimulating learning environment.
                    Despite the challenges that come with teaching physics,
                    such as bridging the gap between students of different backgrounds and abilities,
                    I have found that the rewards of watching my students' growth and achievement make it all worth it.
